# 🍯 SSH Honeypot Lab — Catching Attackers with Cowrie
🔗 [View my portfolio with this lab!](https://akksec.github.io) · Built by [akksec](https://github.com/akksec)

A hands-on cybersecurity project simulating a vulnerable Linux server, deployed to capture, log, and analyze real attacker behavior using the **Cowrie SSH/Telnet honeypot**.

---

## 📌 Objective

Modern servers are constantly probed by automated bots scanning for weak credentials. This project builds a controlled, isolated lab environment to:

- Deploy a realistic-looking SSH honeypot
- Simulate real-world attack techniques (reconnaissance + brute-force)
- Capture and analyze attacker behavior from logs
- Practice core skills relevant to **network forensics, log analysis, and blue-team defense**

└─────────────────────┘                                   └──────────────────────────┘
```

Both VMs run in **VirtualBox**, isolated on a **Host-Only Network** (no internet exposure), with a secondary **NAT adapter** on the honeypot VM used only for package installation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

| Category | Tool |
|---|---|
| Virtualization | VirtualBox |
| Honeypot Target OS | Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS |
| Attacker OS | Kali Linux |
| Honeypot Software | [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie) (SSH/Telnet honeypot) |
| Reconnaissance | Nmap |
| Brute-force Simulation | Hydra |
| Log Analysis | grep, sort, uniq (Bash) |

## ⚙️ Setup Overview

1. Created two isolated VMs in VirtualBox: an Ubuntu Server (target) and Kali Linux (attacker), connected via a Host-Only Network.
2. Installed Cowrie inside a Python virtual environment on the Ubuntu VM, configured to listen on port 2222 and impersonate a real OpenSSH server.
3. Verified the honeypot manually via local SSH connection before exposing it to the simulated attacker.
4. From Kali, performed reconnaissance (`nmap`) and a credential brute-force attack (`hydra`) against the honeypot.
5. Reviewed Cowrie's logs to confirm full capture of the attack lifecycle.

## 🎯 Attack Simulation

**Phase 1 — Reconnaissance**

```
nmap -sV -p 2222 192.168.56.101
```
Result: Cowrie successfully impersonated a real service, returning a fake banner (`OpenSSH 9.2p1 Debian`) — the attacker had no way to distinguish it from a genuine server.

**Phase 2 — Brute-Force Attack**

```
hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt -s 2222 ssh://192.168.56.101
```
32 username/password combinations were attempted.

## 📊 Key Findings

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Total login attempts | 32 |
| Unique attacker IPs | 1 |
| Usernames targeted | `root`, `admin`, `user`, `test` (8 attempts each) |
| Passwords targeted | `toor`, `root`, `qwerty`, `password`, `letmein`, `admin`, `12345678`, `123456` (4 attempts each) |
| Attack duration | ~0.4 seconds |
| Attack signature | Automated/scripted — the speed (32 attempts in under half a second) is far beyond human capability, a clear indicator of tool-based brute-forcing rather than manual login attempts |

Every attempt — including timestamp, session ID, source IP, and credentials used — was fully captured in Cowrie's structured logs, demonstrating the honeypot's core value: turning attacker noise into forensic evidence.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- How honeypots use deception (fake banners, fake filesystems) to lure and log attackers without risking a real system
- How to isolate a lab environment safely using VirtualBox networking (Host-Only vs NAT)
- How to read and parse Cowrie's JSON/text logs to extract actionable data
- How automated attacks differ from manual ones at the log level (timing patterns)
